<h1>Hello summer</h1>
<p>Hello Summer, Hello Summer!
    You are my favorite season of the year
    <br><br>
    Hello Summer, Hello Summer!
    Our exams are over; let us all cheer
    <br><br>
    Hello Summer, Hello Summer!
    Days are longer, Nights are shorter
    <br><br>
    Hello Summer, Hello Summer!
    Sun is brighter, weather is hotter
    <br><br>
    Hello Summer, Hello Summer!
    Sky is clear, Stars shine brighter
    <br><br>
    Hello Summer, Hello Summer!
    Season of the ice-creams, season of the coolers
    <br><br>
    Hello Summer, Hello Summer!
    Children are happier, you are so friendlier
    <br><br>
    Hello Summer, Hello Summer!
    Kids like adventure; can you stay here forever?
